        <h3> How to Train your Dragon 2</h3>
        <p>
          The Viking village of Berk is frequently attacked by dragons, which steal livestock and endanger the villagers. Hiccup,
          the awkward 15-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, is deemed too weak to fight the dragons. Instead,
          he creates mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the village blacksmith, though Hiccup's inventions
          often backfire. Hiccup uses a bolas launcher to shoot down a Night Fury, a rare and dangerous dragon, but cannot bring
          himself to kill the creature and sets him free.

        <h3> How to Train your Dragon 2</h3>
        <p>
          Five years after the Viking villagers of Berk and the dragons made peace, they live together in harmony. Hiccup and
          his dragon, Toothless the Night Fury, discover and map unexplored lands. Now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his
          father, Stoick the Vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although Hiccup feels unsure he is ready.

        <h3> How to Train your Dragon 3</h3>
        <p>
          One year after becoming chieftain, Hiccup, his Night Fury Toothless, and their fellow dragon-riders continue to
          rescue captured dragons to bring them to Berk and its bustling dragon-human utopia. Their efforts have resulted in the
          island becoming overpopulated with dragons. In response, Hiccup desires to find the disguised, a safe haven for
          dragons spoken of by his late father, Stoick. Meanwhile, a white female Fury dragon, held captive by warlords, is given
          to infamous dragon hunter Grimmel the Grisly as bait for him to capture Toothless for the warlords' use as an alpha.
